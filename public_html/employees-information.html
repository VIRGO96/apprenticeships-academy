                   <p>Apprenticeships are a great way to ensure your workforce has the practical skills and qualifications to meet the evolving needs of your business.</p>

                   <h4 class="sub-heading">What is an Apprenticeship?</h4>
                   <p>An Apprenticeship is a work-based training programme designed around the needs of employers, which leads to nationally-recognised qualifications for the apprentice.</p>
                   <p>Our programmes will ensure that your apprentice is properly trained to perform the job you need them to do and you may be eligible to receive government funding.</p>
                   <p>You can use Apprenticeships to recruit and train new employees as well as develop your existing staff to take your business where it needs to go.</p>
                   <h4 class="sub-heading">Who can apply?</h4>
                   <p>Any suitable company can apply.</p>

                   <p>Every Apprentice will be allocated a dedicated Trainer Assessor to offer advice and guidance and plan a bespoke Apprenticeship programme. Trainer Assessors support Apprentices throughout the programme in liaison with you as the Employer.</p>
                   <h4 class="sub-heading">When does it begin?</h4>
                   <p>Recruitment is all year round.</p>
                   <h4 class="sub-heading">Other reasons to apply?</h4>

                   <p>You will receive dedicated advice and support from your personal ASA Apprenticeship Engager who can also help you plan your organisation’s ongoing training and development.</p>
